## Version 4.1.0 - 2023-08-20

* IMPORTANT! SOME SETTINGS WILL BE CHANGED:
  * Artist Extras support is now on
  * Musicbrainz support and Musicbrainz fallback is now on
  * The new Wikimedia support is now on (see below)
* IMPORTANT! 'artistthumb' has been renamed to 'artistthumbnail'
  in the metadata. For most users, this change is invisible, but
  if you use the API directly, be aware of this change.
* IMPORTANT! All of the default templates have had their formatting
  cleaned up here and there.  Additionally, many of the `ws-` files
  have had their CSS cleaned up so that they scale more much more
  proportionaly to the browser window. In OBS, you will likely need
  to remove any excess CSS in the Properties setting in order for
  them to work correctly.  This change makes it possible to use,
  for example, the rotating artist fanart collection in place of
  artist thumbnails as well as have a better chance of success with
  extremely long track titles.
* EXPERIMENTAL! Added support for DJUCED DJ software!
* EXPERIMENTAL! Special handling for Youtube downloaded content that
  hasn't been properly tagged.
* EXPERIMENTAL! When doing some data lookups, if a song is a remix
  then fallback to the non-remixed version to at least try to locate
  artist data.
* Added Wikimedia as a source if the wikidata entity URL is available
  as an artist website, such as if Musicbrainz website data is selected.
* Reworked metadata gathering again and likely lost some performance in the
  process.  But the higher quality sources should now be picked first.
* Discogs should now honor Discogs artist URLs if they are available
  in the artist website data.
* With the last two in mind, discogs and wikidata links from Musicbrainz
  will always be present in the website data if Musicbrainz is turned on.
* Fixed some issues with 'The' disappearing from artist names.
* Musicbrainz lookups should be much more reliable when certain tags
  are defined.
* If covers cannot be found, other artwork may now be substituted via the
  artistextras settings.
* A new websocket example template (`ws-justthecoverhtm`) that just shows
  the cover is now available.
* Template variable 'genres' has been added as a _list_ as opposed to
  'genre' which is a single string.  Only Musicbrainz currently supports
  filling in the 'genres' variable.
* It should now do a better job of using various manipulations of names.
  For example, MӨЯIS BLΛK will also trigger searches for Moris Blak
  in many places. Probably not perfect, but something is better than
  nothing.
* Better support for "artist feat. artist" and other forms of multiple
  artists working together.  However, as a trade-off, some identification
  features that used to work no longer do. For example, "Prince & The
  Revolution" will get recognized for "Purple Rain", but just
  "Prince" may not.)
* theaudiodb language fallback should now work better.
* Added a new twitchbot template that shows track and bio information
  as a more complex example of what can be done with the twitch bot.
* Twitch chat now has a default announcement template that will be set
  on new installs.
* If `Original Date` or `Original Year` tags are able to be read, those
  will be used in place of `Date` and `Year` tags.
* Some comments metadata tags that were not being read correctly should have
  a higher chance of success now.
* Internal: Changed the method by which the software looks for the 'Documents'
  folder on new installs because Windows 11 really wants you to use
  OneDrive.
* Internal: Artwork caching should now work much better when substitutions
  are being done using recognition with the new `imagecacheartist` DB value.
* Internal: Greatly improved a lot of out timeout problems by adding some
  timeout values to many of the 3rd party frameworks in use.  As a result,
  there are a lot more customized bits rather than using off-the-shelf
  components. :(
* Internal: The usual dependency updates.

## Version 4.0.6 - 2023-06-15

* Setlists were not getting created.
* Fresh installs would not actually install.

## Version 4.0.5 - 2023-06-09

* Musicbrainz fill-in feature should be less crash-prone

* keep menu item running longer so users do not think the app is actually
  shut down
* document the windows media support
* change source code line length to 100
* change how plugins are defined

## Version 4.0.4 - 2023-05-07

* Experimental feature: Given an option to use Musicbrainz to fill in missing
  metadata based only on artist and title (and album if available).
* Add support for AVIF graphics. At some point, all of the templates will be
  updated to handle multiple formats so be prepared!
* On Windows, the ability to read from Windows Media Transport compatible
  software, such as Amazon Music, Soundcloud, and likely others. (Ironically,
  Windows Media Player doesn't appear to use it for whatever reason.)
* Ability to disable reading Virtual DJ remix fields from the M3U history file.
  This feature has no impact on what is read from the media itself. In other words,
  if the MP3 is tagged with '(Remix)' that will still show up.
* Twitch redemptions using the 'Twofer' format now has the track title as optional.
* The internal twitch lock should now be less likely to deadlock.
* Some log messages have been bumped up from debut to error.
* Unit tests ran during development have been improved.
* Rework the development process; now almost entirely `pyproject.yaml`-based.
* Some major doc changes here and there.
* Rework and simplify some of the internals of plugins.
* Along with that, sources that do not have the required operating
  system component installed won't show up as a possible selection in the UI.
* The usual dependency updates that should improve program speed and dependability.

## Version 4.0.3 - 2023-03-26

* Force binaries to build with Python 3.10 as 3.11 causes problems.
* Verify the image cache at startup and every hour
* Fixed some bugs around base64 encoding in the webserver
  that would trigger a 500 HTTP error
* missed an await in trackrequest that cause it to go awol

  AcoustID requires MusicBrainz support to be turned on and
  will enforce that.
* If MusicBrainz Artist IDs are present, they will trigger
  artist website URL downloads if MusicBrainz support is enabled.
* There was a bug with enabling Artist Extras and not restarting
  causing (effectively) a hang.  Turning on Artist Extras still
  requires a restart but it should no longer crash the first
  time.

    local install will not re-install on relaunch.
  * whatsnowplayingversion command has been added.  This command is
    a built into the source code to help with debugging
    installs. It cannot be removed or disabled.

    support.
  * On startup, all of the existing twitchbot_ files will be analyzed
    and added to the preferences pane with a default of **DISABLED**.
    You will need to re-enable any that you wish to use.  Command files
    added while the software is running will be available immediately
    but then next startup will be disabled.

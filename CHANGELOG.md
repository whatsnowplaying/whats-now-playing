# Changelog

## Version 4.0.0 - Unreleased

### Major Changes

* New logic for first-time users to try and pre-configure
  some things.  This change also removes the requirement
  of having a file that has to be written.
* Support for Icecast which enables butt, MIXXX, Traktor,
  and many, many more.
* OBS Websocket v5 support for OBS Studio v28+. Older versions
  of OBS Websocket are not supported.
* New UI and Twitch support for requests, including
  randomized requests tied to crates/playlists.
* New Discord support to update a bot's status
* New two computer setup that no longer requires
  using file sharing tricks using the new Beam executable
  and Beam input source.

### Internal/Minor Changes

* Some new and updated templates to clean up some things and to
  show off the new features.

  code changes so that TrackPoll may support asyncio. A
  side benefit has been that various parts of the system
  are just generally faster, more efficient.
* Metadata processing finally got some (simple) parallelization.
* Subprocess handling is now much more streamlined and should
  be less impacted by crashes.
* Serato processing has gotten a major overhaul.

  to ease maintenance.

  AcoustID requires MusicBrainz support to be turned on and
  will enforce that.
* If MusicBrainz Artist IDs are present, they will trigger
  artist website URL downloads if MusicBrainz support is enabled.
* There was a bug with enabling Artist Extras and not restarting

  time.

  * On startup, all of the existing twitchbot_ files will be analyzed
    and added to the preferences pane with a default of **DISABLED**.

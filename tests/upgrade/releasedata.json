This change also removes the requirement of having a file that has to be written.\r\n* Support for Icecast which enables butt, MIXXX, Traktor, and many, many more.\r\n* OBS Websocket v5 support for OBS Studio v28+. Older versions of OBS Websocket are not supported.\r\n* New UI and Twitch support for requests, including randomized requests tied to crates/playlists.\r\n* New Discord support to update a bot's status\r\n* New two computer setup that no longer requires using file sharing tricks using the new Beam executable and Beam input source.\r\n* Upgrades from v1 and v2 are no longer supported.  You will need to upgrade to v3 first if you wish to save your settings.\r\n* The text file output now has the ability to be appended.\r\n\r\n### Internal/Minor Changes\r\n\r\n* About box now in the menu.  Still needs more work, but ...\r\n* Some new and updated templates to clean up some things and to show off the new features.\r\n* SSL Certificate Authority file now uses an internal one supplied by certifi when using pre-built binaries\r\n* Major structural changes internally over a series of code changes so that TrackPoll may support asyncio. A side benefit has been that various parts of the system are just generally faster, more efficient.\r\n* Metadata processing finally got some (simple) parallelization.\r\n* Subprocess handling is now much more streamlined and should be less impacted by crashes.\r\n* Serato processing has gotten a major overhaul.\r\n* Artist URLs should now be normalized as well as better de-duplication (e.g., http vs. https to the same site)\r\n* Moved various bits of source around in the source tree to ease maintenance.\r\n* MusicBrainz should be more reliable in a few instances.\r\n* A few more things are now using pathlib.\r\n* Better error reporting/capturing for a few things.\r\n* A simple JSON-based source plug-in to help test things out.\r\n* The usual doc updates to go with the changes.\r\n* Several dependency updates.\r\n* Python v3.10 is now required."

Turning on Artist Extras still requires a restart but it should no longer crash the first time.\r\n* Twitch bot messages may now be split up by using `{{ startnewmessage }}`  as a template variable.\r\n* Mixmode (Newest/Oldest) got some fixes that now make it correctly unavailable/set for various types of drivers.\r\n* 'Official Music Video' is now removed when clean/explicit/dirty is also removed.\r\n* Some docs updates to clarify some things.\r\n* The Qt test code got a major overhaul to improve debugging the UI.\r\n"

Removing those from your\r\n    local install will not re-install on relaunch.\r\n  * whatsnowplayingversion command has been added.  This command is\r\n    a built into the source code to help with debugging\r\n    installs. It cannot be removed or disabled.\r\n  * A new example !artistshortbio command for the biographies\r\n    support.\r\n  * On startup, all of the existing twitchbot_ files will be analyzed\r\n    and added to the preferences pane with a default of **DISABLED**.\r\n    You will need to re-enable any that you wish to use.  Command files\r\n    added while the software is running will be available immediately\r\n    but then next startup will be disabled.\r\n  * trackdetail got some minor cleanup.\r\n\r\n* New experimental feature: artist extras\r\n\r\n  * Banners\r\n  * Biographies\r\n  * Fan art\r\n  * Logos\r\n  * Thumbnails\r\n\r\n  * Also bundled are some new web server template files that may be used\r\n    as examples for your own stream.\r\n\r\n* New experimental feature: Track title filtering\r\n\r\n  * Some DJ pools will add 'clean', 'dirty', or 'explicit' entries to\r\n    track titles.  There is now a feature to attempt to remove those\r\n    descriptors from the track title.\r\n\r\n* 'artistwebsites' variable has been added and is a list of websites that have\r\n  been either pulled from the tag or from external sources.\r\n* MusicBrainz artist IDs and ISRCs are now lists of IDs. Additionally, Files\r\n  tagged with an ISRC or MusicBrainz Recording IDs should now properly\r\n  short-cut AcoustID DB lookups.\r\n* In several places, locks were switch to be context-based to remove\r\n  resource leakage due to bugs in Python.\r\n* Fixed some leaks that would prevent multiple launches.\r\n* Metadata for date, label, and some MusicBrainz IDs were not always correct.\r\n* More metadata information from FLAC files.\r\n* A bit of tuning on the acoustid recognition code.\r\n* Will now try looking up artists without 'The' attached\r\n* Some log tuning, but also produce more logs with new features and for\r\n  better debugging ability ...\r\n* PNG converter should be less noisy and a bit faster.\r\n* Python 3.9 is now required.\r\n* Some documentation updates.\r\n\r\n## KNOWN BUGS:\r\n\r\n* Serato background update confusion #458 \r\n* Enabling 'Artist Extras' without restarting causes a crash #461 "

Instead, repeat the cycle and make sure it is consistent for the entirety of the delay period.\r\n* Updated various dependencies to fix some security and reliability issues.\r\n* Some documentation updates.\r\n* Python version updated to 3.9\r\n* Upgrades for some CI bits.\r\n\r\nIssues:\r\n\r\n* It has been reported that in some instances, Now Playing is leaving some resources allocated and processes floating around after exiting.  Those problems are still being investigated.  \r\n\r\n"

Please take time to look over the [README](https://github.com/aw-was-here/Now-Playing-Serato/blob/2.0.0/README.md).\r\n\r\n* Main program name change: SeratoNowPlaying -> NowPlaying\r\n* Fixed licensing\r\n  * Added a proper license file\r\n  * Switched to PySide2 and added a NOTICE file for it\r\n* No longer need to pre-create the text file that gets written.\r\n* New HTTP Server built for users who need fade-in/fade-out and other effects\r\n* Rewritten local mode:\r\n  * Cover art in HTTP mode\r\n  * Better character encoding for non-Latin titles\r\n  * Oldest and Newest modes for picking the oldest or newest\r\n    track loaded on a deck\r\n  * Significantly more data available to write out!\r\n* Template-d output instead of hard-coded output settings. Upon first launch, a new NowPlaying directory will appear in your Documents folder. Inside that will be a templates directory that has the example templates.\r\n* Logging infrastructure to help debug.\r\n* Configuration system has been completely revamped.\r\n  * Settings will now survive between software upgrades.\r\n  * Added a 'Reset' button to get you back to defaults.\r\n  * They are now stored in system-friendly ways (e.g., Library/Preferences in OS X).\r\n  * Defaults are much more likely to be correct for your system.\r\n* Major internal, structural changes to allow for easier ability to add new features.\r\n* Now installable via pip\r\n* Significant documentation updates\r\n* Binaries should now report their versions in Get Info/Properties\r\n* Many, many bug fixes... but probably new ones added too."

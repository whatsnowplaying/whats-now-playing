# This workflow file generates binaries for both Windows
# and OS X.  However, https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact/issues/38
# that basically says that it won't ever preserve permissions.
# That means an archive in an archive since we need to preserve them
# on OS X.  Still... better than doing this all by hand.

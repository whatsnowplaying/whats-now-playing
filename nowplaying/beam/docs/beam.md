# Two-Computer Setup With Beam

> NOTE: [Requests](requests.html) are currently unsupported when using
> **Beam**.

Previously, if you perform your DJing on one computer and your streaming
from another, you had to configure IP addresses in OBS or use file
sharing (potentially with [Quirks](quirks.html) enabled).

**What's Now Playing** now includes a special cut-down version of its
software called **Beam**. The **Beam** program will transmit your DJ
computer's track data to another computer running the full **What's Now
Playing** software with nearly zero special network configuration
required.

Using **Beam** is simple:

1.  On your DJ computer:

> 1.  Install and run the **Beam** program
> 2.  Configure your Source as you normally would

2.  On your streaming computer:

> 1.  Install and run the full non-Beam program
> 2.  Configure the Source to be Beam
> 3.  Configure [Outputs](outputs/), [Artist Extras](extras), and any
>     other network-related features

You can check the status of the connection on both sides in Settings
('Beam' on the streaming server, 'Beam Status' on the DJ computer).

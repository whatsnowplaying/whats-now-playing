Bug Reports and Feature Requests
================================

**What's Now Playing** is `open source software <https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source>`_ .
That means unlike commercial software individuals have the capability to
contribute in a variety of ways.  Currently this project is hosted
on  `Github <https://github.com/whatsnowplaying/whats-now-playing>`_ which provides
access to the source code, bugs and feature requests (issues), and a discussion
area where you can ask questions.

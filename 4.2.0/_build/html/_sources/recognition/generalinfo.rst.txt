General Info About Music Recognition
====================================

    NOTE: This feature is only available when using a local music source that provides
    individual files.  It will not work when DJing from external sources.

In general, music recognition is primarily for DJs that do not have their music fully tagged.
This feature may have some significant impacts on **What's Now Playing**'s general performance:

* Extra network bandwidth and access are required to consult with online databases.
* Extra CPU and RAM will be required to generate the 'fingerprint' that helps
  identify the song.
* Extra time will be required for all of this extra work, adding delays to
  the display.

Music recognition technologies will never be perfect and will occasionally
provide surprising results. Tagging your files, even with minimal information,
will give the best outcome.

Open Source
===========

Keep in mind this software is done by volunteers in their spare time! It is also open source,
so if you see something that should be fixed, wrong, or even just general feedback, you are
part of the community as soon as you participate.  Every contribution, no matter how small
you might think it is, helps everyone out.  We appreciate you!

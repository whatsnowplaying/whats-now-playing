`TheAudioDB <https://www.theaudiodb.com>`_ is a community project to provide high quality
artwork and other metadata for music. If `MusicBrainz <https://www.musicbrainz.org>`_
artist ids are available, it will use that information to increase accuracy. You will need a
`TheAudioDB API Key <https://www.theaudiodb.com/api_guide.php>`_ in order to use this service.

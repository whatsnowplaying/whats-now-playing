[TheAudioDB](https://www.theaudiodb.com) is a community project to
provide high quality artwork and other metadata for music. If
[MusicBrainz](https://www.musicbrainz.org) artist ids are available, it
will use that information to increase accuracy. You will need a
[TheAudioDB API Key](https://www.theaudiodb.com/api_guide.php) in order
to use this service.

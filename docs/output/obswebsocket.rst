OBS WebSocket Plug-in
=====================

**What's Now Playing** can use the OBS WebSocket v5 protocol to send results
directly to OBS Studio.  OBS WebSocket v5 protocol was added as a standard feature
in OBS Studio v28.  It will not work with older versions.

      NOTE: The vast majority of OBS users use the `Webserver <webserver.html>`_ output
      to take advantage of cover art and more.  This version **only** provides text and
      only to an OBS Text source.

Installation
------------

#. Configure the OBS WebSocket settings in OBS Studio (Tools->obs-websocket Settings)
#. Configure OBS to have a Text source, keeping track of the name of the source name.
#. Open Settings from the **What's Now Playing** icon
#. Select OBS WebSocket from the list of available input sources.

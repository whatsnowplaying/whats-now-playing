# WinMedia

On Microsoft Windows, applications can publish currently playing media
information to the system. WinMedia reads this data as the source.

This input works with applications that support Windows Media APIs, such as:

- Amazon Music
- Spotify
- Windows Media Player
- Other media applications with Windows integration

## Instructions

1. Open Settings from the **What's Now Playing** icon
2. Select Core Settings->Source from the left-hand column
3. Select WinMedia from the list of available input sources

No additional configuration is required.

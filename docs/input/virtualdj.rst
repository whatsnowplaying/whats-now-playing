Virtual DJ
==========

Virtual DJ is currently configured as an `M3U source <m3u.html>`_ .

1. Pick M3U
2. Select the Documents/Virtual DJ/History directory as the M3U Directory.

If the History does not exist, then you may need to change the time
on Virtual DJ's history output as well as actually play a track on a
deck long enough for the history file to be created.

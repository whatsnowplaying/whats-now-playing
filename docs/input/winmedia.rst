WinMedia
========

On Microsoft Windows, various programs will publish to the system what media is playing.  The `WinMedia` option will read that data
as the Source. There are no extra options, other than to select it.

This input should be used for Amazon Music, Spotify, Windows Media Player, and similar applications that support
Microsoft's Window Media APIs.

Music Recognition
=================

    NOTE: This feature is only available when using a local music source that provides
    individual files.  It will not work when DJing from external sources.

In general, music recognition is primarily for DJs that do not have their music fully tagged.
This feature may have some significant impacts on Now Playing's general performance:

* Extra network bandwidth and access is required to consult with online databases.
* Extra CPU and RAM will be required in order to generate the 'fingerprint' that helps
  identify the song.
* Extra time will be required in order to all of this extra work, adding delays to
  the display.

The results of the music recognition feature are constantly being improved. However, they
will never be perfect and will still likely provide surprising results.  The more information
in the actual music files, the better the results.

ACRCloud utilises patented Automatic Content Recognition (ACR) technology to
enable the generation of a unique real-time fingerprint to identify in a matter
of seconds, the content being played via an audio or video source which is typically
a first screen, in order to trigger an action. With proprietary audio identification
technology, ACRCloud’s is able to identify millions of hours of content in both a
manageable and efficient manner that is highly relevant for advertisers, broadcasters,
video streaming providers, music services, consumer electronics manufacturers and app
developers. ACR’s fingerprint library includes 40 million audio tracks, which is one
of the biggest in the world.

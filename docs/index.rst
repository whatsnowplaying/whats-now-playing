Welcome to Now Playing's documentation!
=======================================

**Now Playing** is a tool written in Python to retrieve the current/last played
song in Serato DJ, Virtual DJ and other software that writes M3U files,
or MPRIS2-compatible software. It gives you full control to use or not use
whatever features you like and fully customize the output to match your
style. You can even pretend to be a fancy music channel:

.. image:: gallery/images/mtv-with-cover.png
   :target: gallery/images/mtv-with-cover.png
   :alt: Example MTV-style with cover Image

Checkout the `gallery <gallery.html>`_ to see more examples!

Compiled, standalone versions are available for:

* Windows

For everyone else, you will need to build and install locally.  See `Developers <developers.html>`_ below.

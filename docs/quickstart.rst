Quickstart
==========

Here are the steps to get a basic installation working:

#. Download and install the binaries using the directions found in `Installation <installation.html>`_
#. Launch the application
#. It should bring up the `Settings <settings.html>`_
#. Configure a File to Write.
#. Configure a `Source <input/index.html>`_
#. Save
#. Bring up your DJ software and play a song.
#. The file you picked to write should now have the song contents a few seconds after the DJ software updates its files. (Virtual DJ has a default 45 second delay, Serato updates on deck update.)


At this point, you are ready to customize via `Templates <templates.html>`_ and enable other features!
